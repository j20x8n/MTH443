MTH443 Advanced Topics in Operations Research
Final Project
Real-World Optimization Problem Solving
Type: Group work
Report and Slides Submission Deadline: Dec 9th (Monday)
Date of Presentation: Dec 11th (Wednesday)
Purpose:
This coursework is designed to enhance your understanding of advanced concepts in Operations Research (OR) while applying these techniques to solve a real-world optimization problem. The goal is to develop skills in modeling, solving, and analyzing optimization problems through practical implementation.
Project Overview:
Each group will select a practical OR problem from a domain of their preference (e.g., logistics, supply chain, transportation, scheduling, etc.). The task involves conducting a literature review, formulating the problem mathematically, developing solution methods, performing computational experiments, and analyzing the results. The final deliverable is a concise report summarizing your findings, along with any relevant code or implementations, and a presentation on the project followed by a QA session.
Instructions:
1. Problem Identification and Literature Review:
 Select a practical OR problem from a domain of your choice (e.g., logistics, supply chain, transportation, scheduling, etc.) that is relevant to the module and get approval from the teacher.
 Provide a clear description of the problem.
 Search for relevant research, and conduct a brief review of existing approaches applied to similar problems.
2. Mathematical Formulation:
 Formulate the mathematical model for the selected problem, specifying the objective function, constraints, and decision variables. Provide a clear explanation of the formulation, including any assumptions made.
3. Solution Method:
 Design and develop heuristic method(s) to effectively solve large-scale instances of the problem.
 Implement the chosen solution using a programming language of your choice.
4. Computational Experiments:
 Generate instances to te代 写MTH443 Advanced Topics in Operations ResearchR
代做程序编程语言st your solution method, using either real-world data or existing benchmark instances.
 Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the method   under various scenarios, highlighting any special characteristics observed in the problem.
5. Results Analysis and Interpretation:
 Provide a thorough analysis of the computational results.
 Discuss the implications of your findings and any practical insights derived from the results.
6. Report writing:
 Write a report (maximum 2000 words, excluding figures, tables and appendix) that includes the following sections:
o Introduction: introduce the topic and your motivation. Briefly review the relevant current research.
o Problem definition and mathematical formulation: Define the problem and present the mathematical model.
o Solution Method: Describe the solution methods. Use flowchart or pseudocode if needed.
o Computational results: Present experiment design, results, and analysis.
o Conclusions: summarize the main results and insights.
o References (if any): List all references cited in your report. Make sure the citation style. is correct and consistent.
o Appendix (if any)：Include any additional materials.
 Ensure logical structure, clarity, conciseness, and formality in your writing.
 Include a cover page with the project title, module and coursework information, and group member information.
7. Presentation:
 Prepare a 15 mins presentation summarizing your project.
 The presentation should be concise, engaging, and well-organized, using visual aids (e.g., slides, graphs, diagrams) to support your explanation.
 Participate in a 5 min QA session.
8. Submission:
 LMO submission should contain the following three files:
o A PDF file of your report
o A ZIP file containing all your code and data
o A PPT file of your presentation
 Name your files: [GroupID]_[Report/Code/PPT]_MTH443FinalProject.
